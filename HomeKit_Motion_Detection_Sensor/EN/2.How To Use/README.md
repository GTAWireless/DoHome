## 1.Use under Homekit

## Step 1: Configure device networking
When the device is powered on, open a hotspot of Homekit-sensor_xxxx and connect the hotspot of "Homekit-sensor_xxxx" with the password of "12345678", and wait about 3 seconds. The mobile phone will automatically jump to the distribution network interface. Note: If there are multiple devices, please pay attention to distinguishing different hotspot names.
If the mobile phone does not automatically jump to the distribution network interface, please open the mobile browser input: htt://192.168.4.1, waiting to enter the distribution network interface. Please select your family WiFi name in the jump page, and enter your password in the password, and click join.

1. Make sure that equipment, mobile phone and router are close to each other in the process of distribution network.

2. Make sure the password of the router is correct in the process of distribution network.

3. Make sure that the router works in 2.4 G band and enables broadcasting, and works in non-11 n only mode.

4. In the process of network distribution, please ensure that the router wireless encryption mode is wpa2-psk type, the authentication type is AES, or both are set to automatic.

5. If the router opens wireless MAC address filtering in the process of distribution network, please remove the device from the router's MAC filter list; make sure that the router has firewall function. If yes, please turn off the firewall function and then try to connect the device to the router.

6. If it is a dual-band router, please set different passwords for 2.4G signal and 5G signal, or turn off 5G signal. Do not turn on the dual-band function.
Q: If I have already configured it, what should I do if I want to reconfigure it?

Most of the 70% to 80% of the problems can be restored to the factory settings. If not, please restore the factory settings and try again.
